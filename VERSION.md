## Current

**0.6.0** — Gate enforcement and design doc discipline. ACTIVE→REVIEW gate now checks `.testers_done` marker — blocks if Testers haven't completed before Reviewers. All 7 agents updated with "update design doc after work" steps. Testers agent codifies pytest best practices (venv, PYTHONPATH, pytest-asyncio, no rtk pytest). Pytest ICM learning stored permanently.
