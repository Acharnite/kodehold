## Version Scheme

`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`

- **MAJOR**: Breaking changes to KodeHold methodology or architecture
- **MINOR**: New features, teams, or ADRs added
- **PATCH**: Documentation updates, refinements, bug fixes

## Current

**1.23.0** — Loop Engineering Phase 2 completion. `scripts/loop_runner.py` (Python) replaces `loop-run.sh` (opencode run). All 3 L1 loops are now pure Python with Discord webhook notifications. ADR-0059 accepted — workspace.py rewritten with 10 subcommands and YAML registry. Deprecated ADR-0007 and `.opencode/memory/` references cleaned from all active files.

**1.22.0** — Removed all `.sh` scripts — 9 bash scripts deleted (gate.sh, workspace.sh, ship.sh, benchmark.sh, sync-agent-config.sh, validate-config.sh, token-usage.sh, detect-test-framework.sh, output.sh). All references across 10 files updated to `.py` equivalents with `python3` prefix.

**1.21.0** — ADR-0054 completion: Replaced all remaining OpenCode RAG references with Graphify across all documentation. Created `graphify-knowledge-flow` skill replacing `opencode-rag-knowledge-flow`. Updated AGENTS.md, design doc (§7.2, §7.4, §10), skills README, root README, ADR-0050, ADR-0051, config/agents.yaml, director.md, TODO.md, and VERSION.md. Graphify is now the sole documented code retrieval method; platform-level OpenCode RAG tools are noted as not part of KodeHold's workflow.

**1.19.0** — Design doc Section 8.1 updated — vLLM documented as recommended local inference provider. Concurrent LLM + Embedding serving architecture. References ADR-0053.

**1.15.0** — ADR-0052 Structured Durable Execution — Formal Checkpoint Schema and Auto-Checkpoint (Accepted).

**1.12.1** — Agentmemory v0.9.25 upgrade. 5 obsolete patches removed (triggerVoid, summary XML parse, viewer-bind, merged patch, summary XML parse src) and archived to `patches-v0.9.24/`. New minimal `patches/agentmemory-viewer-bind-0.9.25.patch` bypasses AGENTMEMORY_SECRET requirement for non-loopback viewer binds. Viewer bind now via `AGENTMEMORY_VIEWER_HOST=0.0.0.0` env var. systemd service updated to v0.9.25. All upstream bug fixes from our reports now included: triggerVoid migration (PR #773), summary XML markdown fence parsing (PR #791), graph pagination, sharded index persistence, smart-search diagnostics, cross-project memory leakage fix, consolidation auto-enable, and 0 npm audit vulnerabilities.

**0.19.2** — Project slug convention (ADR-0036): project identifiers migrated from filesystem paths to stable slugs across Director protocol, workspace scripts, and design docs. New custom KodeHold viewer server (`tools/viewer/serve.mjs`, port 3115) with Slots tab. Director protocol updated to use stable slug `project` field. Workspace scripts validate project names as slugs; catalog uses `project: name` field.

**0.19.1** — CI stability fixes: ADR format smoke test SIGPIPE antipatch resolved (direct `grep -q` instead of piped `echo`), agentmemory health check warns instead of failing when daemon unreachable (three-way logic: connection refused → WARN, 2xx → PASS, 4xx/5xx → FAIL), obsolete ICM setup steps removed from CI workflow.

**0.19.0** — ICM → Agentmemory Migration (Phases 1-5). Complete replacement of ICM memory system with agentmemory. New ADR-0030 (Knowledge Flow), ADR-0031 (Actions + Crystals), ADR-0032 (Routine Templates), ADR-0033 (Crystals + Signals). Director now uses Action Frontier Protocol with memory_frontier + memory_lease + memory_crystallize. 4 standard flow templates (ADR, implement, bugfix, ship-gate). Auto-crystallize triggers (every 5 actions, state transitions, routine completion, explicit). Inter-agent signaling (5 types). All 6 team agents, scripts/gate.sh, scripts/ship.sh, references updated.

**0.17.1** — CodeRabbitAI review fix: added runtime validation for `info?.directory` in agentmemory-capture.ts. Replaces `(info?.directory as string)` type assertion with `typeof` + length check per PR #749. ADR-0028 updated with finalized date (2026-06-01) and validation documentation.

**0.17.0** — ICM memoir restructure: 7 team-specific memoirs merged into `kodehold-teams` (27 concepts, 16 links). All learnings consolidated into `kodehold-learnings` (63 concepts, 68 links). All ADR references updated to reflect new consolidated structure. CLOSED→REOPEN→ACTIVE lifecycle transition completed.

**0.16.0** — ADR-0021 accepted (Prospective Memory design for deferred + recurring tasks via ICM). Lifecycle simulation document with 4 complete scenarios. ADR cleanup: 5 ADRs resolved (Superseded/Deprecated). Director delegation lesson documented. OPENCODE_NONINTERACTIVE env leak test fix.

**0.15.2** — ADR-0027 implementation review fixes. SKILL.md renumbered to match ADR-0027, docs updated with invocation modes, second-opinion.md standardized, typo fixed.

**0.15.1** — Updated all 6 agent files with ADR-0027 invocation modes. Scribes uses Post-task only; other teams use Pre-task default. Fixes token waste and semantic confusion.

**0.14.0** — Dedicated second-opinion subagent with Google Gemma 3 12B via OpenRouter. OpenRouter configured as provider. Director routes second opinions to dedicated subagent. Reviewers.md cleaned up. Resolves issue #12 (bias problem).

**0.13.4** — ICM Knowledge Flow skill frontmatter fix. Added YAML frontmatter to `.opencode/skills/icm-knowledge-flow/SKILL.md` so the skill registers correctly with OpenCode's discovery.

**0.13.3** — Shipping gate alignment. AGENTS.md and ship.sh now agree on step count (8 total: 1 manual Team Meeting + 7 automated). CHANGES.md check upgraded from warn to fail. Team Meeting clarified as manual pre-requisite.

**0.13.2** — Fixed FLS ICM protocol inconsistency. Removed direct `icm_memory_store` call from FLS workflow. FLS now delegates ICM storage to Scribes via Director, consistent with ADR-0010 and director.md delegation patterns.

**0.13.1** — Shipping gate alignment. AGENTS.md now correctly documents 8 steps (1 manual + 7 automated in ship.sh). CHANGES.md check in ship.sh upgraded from warn to fail. Team Meeting clarified as manual pre-requisite.

**0.13.0** — Dependabot configuration added. `.github/dependabot.yml` enables weekly automated dependency updates for GitHub Actions (version + security) and npm packages in `.opencode/`.
